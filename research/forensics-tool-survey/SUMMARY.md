# Survey Summary

## What This Corpus Contains

This survey corpus contains raw HTML, extracted text, WP source links, DIDCTF tool database entries, and a tool-frequency summary collected from:

- `https://www.yagami.vip`
- `https://forensics.xidian.edu.cn`
- `https://forensics.didctf.com`

## Main Tables

Use these three files for the next VM update phase:

- `wp_links.csv`
  - source link table for collected writeups
- `tool_frequency_total.csv`
  - main tool ranking table with per-source counts; DIDCTF site pages and DIDCTF external writeups are merged into one `didctf` column
- `didctf_tool_database.csv`
  - DIDCTF tool collection table with categories, tags, download links, GitHub links, websites, icons, and timestamps

## How To Use This For The VM

Start from `tool_frequency_total.csv` when deciding which tools should be added, upgraded, or promoted in the launcher.

Use `didctf_tool_database.csv` to find project links, download links, GitHub links, and official websites.

Use `wp_links.csv` to trace why a tool appeared in the corpus and which source material supported the ranking.
